      Kittyhaus is based in Orange County, CA.
      <br />
      <br />
      Working with MeoowzResq, we have helped hundreds of foster kittens and cats find a furrever home. 
      <br />
      <br />
      Our goal is to bring awareness to the option of adopting from local animal rescues over buying from a pet store or breeder.
      <br />
      <br />
      Each season will be streamed daily when possible until the kittens and cats are adopted out.
      <br />
      <br />
      All kittens on the stream will be available for adoption on a first come first serve basis. Please contact us if you are interested 
      <br />
      <br />
      The Kittyhaus playground consists of customized and repurposed IKEA furniture, our in-house creations and furniture from brands we love.
