        Kittyhaus is based in Southern California.
        <br />
        <br />
        Working with a local rescue, we have helped over 100 foster kittens and cats find a furrever home. 
        <br />
        <br />
        Our goal is to bring awareness to the option of adopting from your local animal rescues over buying from a pet store or breeder.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Kittyhaus playground consists of customized and repurposed IKEA furniture, our in-house creations and cat furniture brands we love.
        <br />
        <br />
        Each season will be streamed daily when possible until the kittens and cats are adopted out.
